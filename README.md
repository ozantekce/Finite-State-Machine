# Finite_State_Machine
 My Finite State Machine Template For Unity
 
After using the Finite State Machine for a long time, I decided to develop a Finite State Machine myself. I tried to develop a structure that would be a solution to the problems I actively encountered, and unlike the other structures I used, I set up a simpler and more useful structure by using Delegates. I have added some examples, you can review these examples.<br />

I will add new examples and documentation as soon as possible.<br />
